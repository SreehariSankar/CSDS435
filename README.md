# CSDS435
CSDS435 Data Mining
Homework coding assingments for CSDS 435.

HW5 update: Please download "data.zip" and ANN.py. Extract data.zip into the folder and simply run ANN.py

ANN.py contains a basic neural network class to show the backpropogration algorithm. Do not expect much performance, even with tuned hyper-parameters.
ANN.py is INCAPABLE of creating a deep neural network, as engineering along those lines is out of the scope of this class. 

Please let me know if there are any problems.
